 About the Legend
 </h1>
 <p>
 Mahatma Gandhi (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi) played an important role in India’s struggle for freedom.
 <br> Mahatma Gandhi is known for his policy of truth and non-violence.<br>

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi was a major political and spiritual leader of India who led the country in the non-cooperation movement in 1922 and Salt march in 1930 and later in Quit India movement in 1942 during its struggle for independence. <br>Known as Beloved Baapu in India, Mahatma Gandhi adopted the policy of mass disobedience and non-violent resistance as weapons against the British Rule in India and followed a principle of Ahimsa (total Non-Violence).<br> He endured several hardships, was arrested and occasionally beaten in his journey and struggle to Justice and Freedom. However, his struggle does not restrict to India itself, as the leader played a key role in the Civil Rights movement in South Africa and secured them the right to justice and equality. <br>His birthday 2 October is commemorated as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday and as the International Non-Violence day across the world.

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born in Porbandar, a town in Gujarat in western India on 2 October 1869.<br >His father Karamchand Gandhi was the Diwan of Porbandar state of British India. <br>His mother Putlibai was Karamchand’s fourth wife. <br> born in a Hindu family Gandhi strictly followed vegetarianism and fasting as means of self-purification.<br> At the age of 13 he was married to one year older kasturba.<br> In 1885, Kasturbai gave birth to their first child who survived only few days. <br>Later the couple had four sons. All along his schooling days Gandhi was an average student and passed his matriculation exam from Samaldas College, Gujarat with some difficulty.<br> On 4th September 1888, he traveled to England to study law at the university College London and to train as a barrister, as his family wanted him to be a barrister.
